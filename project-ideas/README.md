# QR Codes

## Introduction

QR Codes are one of the ways in which links can be made available in public spaces. They allow you to save a specific address to which you want the user to go after scanning the code.

From a marketing point of view, an interesting solution would be to create an application that will allow the user to manage the address to which the queries from a given QR code are to be redirected.

## How to Start
Implement the following features:
1. Creating an agency (user) account,
2. Create a QR code,
3. Configure the address to which queries from this QR code should be redirected,
4. Saving statistics for each QR code,
5. Implementation of different pricing plans (maximum number of QR codes per user may vary).


# Parking Sharing

## Introduction
The economy of sharing is about making your own resources available to others when you don't use them for a certain amount of money. Think of a situation where you have a garage, but every day you pay for parking next to the office building you work in, and someone else has a garage next to your office building and works next to your house and also pays for parking every day. Your situation could be improved if someone contacted you and told you that you could just share a garage between 8 and 16.

## How to Start
How to start
Implement the following features:
Create an application that allows you to add a place to rent for specific hours/days of the week (maybe someone is going away on weekends?)
Implement a communication mechanism (sending messages),
Implement an interesting ads browsing interface (maybe something more than a list of ads - a map?)
